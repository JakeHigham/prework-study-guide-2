# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created as a tool to introduce myself to the basic foundations of coding. Completing it has given me a better understanding of what can be expected of me in the future. I hope that it serves as a guide for anybody who comes across it and can help them when they're starting out with coding!
